**EALPR: Egyptian Automatic License Plate Recognition (Plates)** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the surveillance industry. 

The dataset consists of 2068 images with 10797 labeled objects belonging to 27 different classes including *١*, *م*, *أ*, and other: *٦*, *س*, *ر*, *٥*, *د*, *٤*, *ع*, *٧*, *ھ*, *٢*, *ن*, *و*, *٣*, *ل*, *٩*, *ج*, *ب*, *ى*, *٨*, *ق*, *ط*, *ف*, *ص*, and *٠*.

Images in the EALPR: Plates dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 90 (4% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2021 by the Fayoum University, Egypt and Minia University, Egypt.
